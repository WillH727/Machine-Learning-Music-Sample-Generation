# Machine-Learning-Music-Sample-Generation

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning system that reads hundreds of samples and use this data to then generate its own samples based off the trainned data.

The first attempt was to build LSTM (Long short-term memory), which is a great model for finding relationships based off time incrementing data.
It works by LSTM neurons intreating with a pervious set of data based off the last incrememnt and is able to have long term memory by having 'roads' of little to no differiantion to stop gradient run off.
